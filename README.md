# Silent Auction

I am moving to Canada, and I am hosting a silent auction house party for my
friends to buy all of my possessions. This is the back end of the app used to
view items and make bids.

I'm using this as a chance to learn something new, and that something new is
Elixir. So far, I'm absolutely loving it.

## Installation

You'll need PostgreSQL running, which is beyond the scope of this guide. Then,
copy `.env.dist` to `.env`, set the variables, and run it like it's a Mix
project. Idk man, I'm only just learning this language and have only run unit
tests so far, not deployed it anywhere.
